Please hear me out at first to understand and don't do anything yet.

Context:
I am a Muslim and Eid-ul-Adha is knocking at the door. So, we have to buther a cow and devide it equally amoung our shares.

Task:
I want such a webapp, simple (with HTML, CSS, JS) yet functional and neice looking. In the webapp, I will be able to keep track of which part has been devided into which amount. The mandatory things that needs to be included:
- Field for total number of shares.
- A table with editable fields to keep track of the part name, the total amount, the amount per share and a tally type system to keep track how many have got their shares of that part.
- A button to the export the table as pdf.
- The data should be saved so that even after reload, they are not lost. Add a button to clear the saves as well.

Reason:
Every year, we do this calculations manually. It is very time consuming and most of the time I make mistake. And also I have to present the calculation with others. So, I want this to make way more convenient and gorgeous looking to able to present it to the others.

Role:
Suppose, you are a 20+ years experienced developer looking forward to spend a really nice eid vacation. But you are in the same place at mine, making your life complex instead of joyful but doing diving calculation manually and then your mind clicked for this idea to implement. This year, you are determinant to enjoy you vacation to the fullest......
